		apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-bin xdg-utils

  b] Dependencies for PiBreeze Plugins
     The following dependencies are required to build PiBreeze Plugins

     1] Qt4/Qt5 Modules
        a] QtWebKit (libqt5webkit5-dev) (Qt5 <= 5.4)
        b] QtWebEngine (qtwebengine5-dev) (Qt5 >= 5.5)
        c] QScintilla (libqt5scintilla2-dev or libqscintilla2-qt5-dev)
     2] libpoppler-qt5 (libpoppler-qt5-dev)
     3] libdjvulibre-dev (libdjvulibre-dev)

     Type the following command (on Debian and Debian based systems) to install the above dependencies (with root previleges)

		apt-get install libqt5webkit5-dev libqscintilla2-qt5-dev libpoppler-qt5-dev libdjvulibre-dev

  c] Installation locations
     You need to set the locations where you want to install newbreeze, and its plugins. By default, the prefix is /usr.
     The pibreeze app is installed at /usr/bin/, libpibreeze.so at /usr/lib/pibreeze, plugins at /usr/lib/pibreeze/plugins.
     These are set in the respective .pro files. You'll have to edit the individual .pro files.

     NOTE: Please make note that we use RPATH to locate libpibreeze.so. Setting improper values to $PREFIX, or in QMAKE_RPATHDIR
     will result in pibreeze crashing out with error.

2. Building
===========
  a] Preparing the Makefile
     In the terminal, type

         qmake -qt5

  b] Building
     In the terminal, type

         make -j4

     Feel free to replace 4 in 'make -j4' with the number of cpu cores you have.

3. Installation
===============
     In the terminal, type

         sudo make install

     This will install PiBreeze, the plugins and all the include files in the location set during Stage 1
